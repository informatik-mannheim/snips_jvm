# header 1

// +EXC
This is the solution. Please note that a # cannot be used as a comment in R markdown as it indicates a header. So // is used instead.
// -EXC

# header 2

This is an example with a code chunk:
```{r}
a = 1
# +EXC
# This code will be removed in the public solution:
print(a)
# -EXC
```
